  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>I have spent most of my adult life working in the service industry, but now work as a carpenter.
        I grew up in the country, and have finally made my return to living in the country. As such, I 
        would love the opportunity to work remotely and make a living wage, so I am trying to learn how to
        code so that I can achieve the lifestyle I most desire.
    </p>
  <h2>Education</h2>
    <p>I have a bachelor's degree in Health Science, and outside of a brief stint working as a food safety
      inspector for the Oregon Department of Agriculture, I never succeeded at pursuing a career in the 
      way my college education suggested I might.
